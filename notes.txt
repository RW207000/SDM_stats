Want to achieve:
- ** combine Nov23-Nov24 with Nov24-Feb25 (because Nov24-Feb25 only has 10 data points)
- total daily standarised doses for each medication
- flag HC daily dose <8mg and >20mg per BSA
- ** add n number to stats
- performs stats on all other numerical fields from minimal dataset (e.g.: height, weight, BMI, renin, testosterone, glucose, BPs)
- look at dose timings, per centre per drug
- ** 17 ohp and andro lab values women vs men per centre
- *** HC dose trends per centre (including individual doses and 
		FOR "total daily doses", will need to factor in patients on single or combined therapies)
- blood pressure - spread of values for both diastolic vs systolic and subsequent categories


NOTE - there's lots of lab data entered as free text in 'Notes' section (e.g.: HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides etc) which is currently excluded from analyses due to it begin present as free text.
